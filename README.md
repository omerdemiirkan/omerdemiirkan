- âš¡ ^^About Me^^
- 
     I received basic education in business administration and software technologies during my academic semester, and after the academic semester I am working to specialize in this field. During the academic semester and after, I constantly improve my approach to solving problems, identifying the problem and developing new ideas on an initiative basis, a predisposition to teamwork, and a high motivation for research and development. I believe that my human relationships are strong, that they can adapt to any conditions. I am looking for an inspiring work environment that will allow me to improve myself even more with a good education.
